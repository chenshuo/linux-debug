Description:	(RW) Controls the weight of Tx completion TLPs, which influence
		the proportion of outbound completion TLPs on the PCIe link.
		The available tune data is [0, 1, 2]. Writing a negative value
		will return an error, and out of range values will be converted
		to 2. The value indicates a probable level of the event.
