/**
 * struct drm_i915_context_engines_parallel_submit - Configure engine for
 * parallel submission.
 *
 * Setup a slot in the context engine map to allow multiple BBs to be submitted
 * in a single execbuf IOCTL. Those BBs will then be scheduled to run on the GPU
 * in parallel. Multiple hardware contexts are created internally in the i915
 * run these BBs. Once a slot is configured for N BBs only N BBs can be
 * submitted in each execbuf IOCTL and this is implicit behavior e.g. The user
 * doesn't tell the execbuf IOCTL there are N BBs, the execbuf IOCTL knows how
 * many BBs there are based on the slot's configuration. The N BBs are the last
 * N buffer objects or first N if I915_EXEC_BATCH_FIRST is set.
 *
 * The default placement behavior is to create implicit bonds between each
 * context if each context maps to more than 1 physical engine (e.g. context is
 * a virtual engine). Also we only allow contexts of same engine class and these
 * contexts must be in logically contiguous order. Examples of the placement
 * behavior described below. Lastly, the default is to not allow BBs to
 * preempted mid BB rather insert coordinated preemption on all hardware
 * contexts between each set of BBs. Flags may be added in the future to change
 * both of these default behaviors.
 *
 * Returns -EINVAL if hardware context placement configuration is invalid or if
 * the placement configuration isn't supported on the platform / submission
 * interface.
 * Returns -ENODEV if extension isn't supported on the platform / submission
 * interface.

 *
 *	Example 1 pseudo code:
 *	CS[X] = generic engine of same class, logical instance X
 *	INVALID = I915_ENGINE_CLASS_INVALID, I915_ENGINE_CLASS_INVALID_NONE
 *	set_engines(INVALID)
 *	set_parallel(engine_index=0, width=2, num_siblings=1,
 *		     engines=CS[0],CS[1])
 *
 *	Results in the following valid placement:
 *	CS[0], CS[1]
 *
 *	Example 2 pseudo code:
 *	CS[X] = generic engine of same class, logical instance X
 *	INVALID = I915_ENGINE_CLASS_INVALID, I915_ENGINE_CLASS_INVALID_NONE
 *	set_engines(INVALID)
 *	set_parallel(engine_index=0, width=2, num_siblings=2,
 *		     engines=CS[0],CS[2],CS[1],CS[3])
 *
 *	Results in the following valid placements:
 *	CS[0], CS[1]
 *	CS[2], CS[3]
 *
 *	This can also be thought of as 2 virtual engines described by 2-D array
 *	in the engines the field with bonds placed between each index of the
 *	virtual engines. e.g. CS[0] is bonded to CS[1], CS[2] is bonded to
 *	CS[3].
 *	VE[0] = CS[0], CS[2]
 *	VE[1] = CS[1], CS[3]
 *
 *	Example 3 pseudo code:
 *	CS[X] = generic engine of same class, logical instance X
 *	INVALID = I915_ENGINE_CLASS_INVALID, I915_ENGINE_CLASS_INVALID_NONE
 *	set_engines(INVALID)
 *	set_parallel(engine_index=0, width=2, num_siblings=2,
 *		     engines=CS[0],CS[1],CS[1],CS[3])
 *
 *	Results in the following valid and invalid placements:
 *	CS[0], CS[1]
 *	CS[1], CS[3] - Not logical contiguous, return -EINVAL
