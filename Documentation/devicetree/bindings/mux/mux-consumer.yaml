title: Common multiplexer controller consumer bindings

description: |
  Mux controller consumers should specify a list of mux controllers that they
  want to use with a property containing a 'mux-ctrl-list':

    mux-ctrl-list ::= <single-mux-ctrl> [mux-ctrl-list]
    single-mux-ctrl ::= <mux-ctrl-phandle> [mux-ctrl-specifier]
    mux-ctrl-phandle : phandle to mux controller node
    mux-ctrl-specifier : array of #mux-control-cells specifying the
                         given mux controller (controller specific)

  Mux controller properties should be named "mux-controls". The exact meaning of
  each mux controller property must be documented in the device tree binding for
  each consumer. An optional property "mux-control-names" may contain a list of
  strings to label each of the mux controllers listed in the "mux-controls"
  property.

  mux-ctrl-specifier typically encodes the chip-relative mux controller number.
  If the mux controller chip only provides a single mux controller, the
  mux-ctrl-specifier can typically be left out.

    description:
      Devices that use more than a single mux controller can use the
      "mux-control-names" property to map the name of the requested mux
      controller to an index into the list given by the "mux-controls" property.
