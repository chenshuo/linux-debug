Assists are long sequences of uops that are required in certain corner-cases for operations that cannot be handled natively by the execution pipeline. For example; when working with very small floating point values (so-called Denormals); the FP units are not set up to perform these operations natively. Instead; a sequence of instructions to perform the computation on the Denormals is injected into the pipeline. Since these microcode sequences might be dozens of uops long; Assists can be extremely deleterious to performance and they can be avoided in many cases. Sample with: OTHER_ASSISTS.ANY",
