Frontend denotes the first part of the processor core responsible to fetch operations that are executed later on by the Backend part.

Ideally the Frontend can issue Machine_Width uops every cycle to the Backend. Frontend Bound denotes unutilized issue-slots when there is no Backend stall; i.e. bubbles where Frontend delivered no uops while Backend could have accepted them.
