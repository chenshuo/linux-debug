This is a very old driver for very old hardware (specifically
laptops that use this sensor). In addition according to reports
the picture quality is quite bad.

This is also one of the few drivers still not using the vb2
framework (or even the old videobuf framework!), so this driver
is now deprecated with the intent of removing it altogether by
the end of 2022.

In order to keep this driver it has to be converted to vb2.
