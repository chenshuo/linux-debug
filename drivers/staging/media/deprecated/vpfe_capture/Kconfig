	  Enables DaVinci CCD hw module. DaVinci CCDC hw interfaces
	  with decoder modules such as TVP5146 over BT656 or
	  sensor module such as MT9T001 over a raw interface. This
	  module configures the interface and CCDC/ISIF to do
	  video frame capture from slave decoders.

	  This driver is deprecated and is scheduled for removal by
	  the beginning of 2023. See the TODO file for more information.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. There will
	  be two modules called vpfe_capture.ko and dm644x_ccdc.ko
