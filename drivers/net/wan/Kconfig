menuconfig WAN
	bool "Wan interfaces support"
	help
	  Wide Area Networks (WANs), such as X.25, Frame Relay and leased
	  lines, are used to interconnect Local Area Networks (LANs) over vast
	  distances with data transfer rates significantly higher than those
	  achievable with commonly used asynchronous modem connections.

	  Usually, a quite expensive external device called a `WAN router' is
	  needed to connect to a WAN. As an alternative, a relatively
	  inexpensive WAN interface card can allow your Linux box to directly
	  connect to a WAN.

	  If you have one of those cards and wish to use it under Linux,
	  say Y here and also to the WAN driver for your card.

	  If unsure, say N.

	tristate "COSA/SRP sync serial boards support"
	depends on ISA && m && ISA_DMA_API && HDLC && VIRT_TO_BUS
	help
	  Driver for COSA and SRP synchronous serial boards.

	  These boards allow to connect synchronous serial devices (for example
	  base-band modems, or any other device with the X.21, V.24, V.35 or
	  V.36 interface) to your Linux box. The cards can work as the
	  character device, synchronous PPP network device, or the Cisco HDLC
	  network device.

	  You will need user-space utilities COSA or SRP boards for downloading
	  the firmware to the cards and to set them up. Look at the
	  <http://www.fi.muni.cz/~kas/cosa/> for more information. You can also
	  read the comment at the top of the <file:drivers/net/wan/cosa.c> for
	  details about the cards and the driver itself.

	  The driver will be compiled as a module: the
	  module will be called cosa.
